I am a highly motivated developer and hard-working individual with strong experience in the E-Commerce industry for over 7 years. I apply tools like Kubernetes, Docker, and git versioning to build and package APIs mainly with programming languages like Typescript, C#, C++, Golang, Rust and PHP.

- I like to migrate and transform legacy software leveraging the right tools into modern solutions
- I like to create resilient infrastructure designs and solutions
- I'm currently working mainly with Google Cloud Services
- I've previously worked a lot with AWS
